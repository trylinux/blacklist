OpenDNSBL Security Framework
=========
OpenDNSBL framework is more than just a way of creating RFC-complaint DNSBL zones that are based upon traffic from sensors you configure, it's new away of looking at cyber-security. While still in it's infancy, this is an attempt to create a community driven security framework that allows whatever type of detection software output to be turned into a defense strategy.  

This project was and is continually developed by the CARI.net Security Incident Response Team (sirt@cari.net). The primary maintainer is Zach W.
